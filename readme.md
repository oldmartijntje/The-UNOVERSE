# timetravel

I have thought a lot about how to handle timetravel, since you have to make it playable.

## idea 1

When you travel in time, you take your hand with you, but it's the same timeline, When you are in the same timeline you can change it, but when you change it so that the original you doesn't go back in time at that point, that's a paradox.

### newer 

Since i have come up with the idea of time travel cards that keep their destionaation, THis wouldn't be a paradox anymore, since if the main you doesn't go back in time that turn, he still can do it in the future, but that means that you would have less / different cards in your hand when you travel back, making cards the new you has played probably impossible.

## idea 2

Timelines, when you go back, you take your hand with you to that earlier point, 2 you's exist there, but if you change it, you won't cause a paradox. but this will leave a timeline without you? is that a good or fun idea?

### fix

to fix this you could add a card to hop between timelines, but idk if that's a good idea
